This project was created as part of the curriculum for the Full Stack Web Development Program at Career Foundry , the worst online program I have ever had the misfortune of being swindled by. I cannot warn anyone against enrolling in this criminal program strongly enough. 

Here’s an exact quote from the instruction for an assignment in which using TypeDoc is a requirement:

> “Spend a little time familiarizing yourself with TypeDoc first, since we didn’t cover it in the Exercise”

I paid $8,000 to be told. “Go figure this out somewhere else on your own – but we here at CareerFoundry will still have the audacity to make something which we did not teach, a requirement to pass the course.”
Crooks. Absolute crooks.
